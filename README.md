# Weekend Redux Feedback Loop

## Weekend Challenge #5

### Description

The Redux Feedback Loop allows users to submit a survey summarizing their thoughts regarding content they are learning. They submit numeric scores on a scale of 1-5 based on their current level of feelings, understanding, and support. They are then directed to a comment page where they can submit any other thoughts they might have. 

Finally, they are directed to a Review page where they review their scores and comment before submitting them. Upon submission, the information is sent to a database and the user is sent to a 'Success' page confirming their information was sent. Users can then click a button to take the survey again.
